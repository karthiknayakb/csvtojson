# csvtojson

This simple code will convert any csv file to a json file (dictionary).
The parseCSV function takes filename(path to csv -> string), pkey(key -> string), fields(fieldnames of csv -> tuple).

clone the repository and run csvtojson.py, you will get a parsedCSV.json file in the same directory.

Note: I have not handled the heading (if present) in the csv file. I'll do it in future. You are welcome to contribute.
